Foxytale gives you the opportunity to arrange your pictures into creative stories (Tales) and to share them with the rest of the world.

Foxytale is an IOS Social Media App programmed in Objectiv C using the Parse Framework. 
The project was built as a part of my master thesis: „Vergleich von „Backend-as-a-Service“ – 
Anbietern für die Umsetzung in einer IOS Social-Media APP“, to review Facebook Parse Backend as a Service against other Baas provider. 
Due to the shutting down of Parse the APP is no longer available in the APP store.
